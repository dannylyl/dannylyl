<!-- About section -->
---
✨ I'm currently an AI Apprentice at [AI Singapore](https://aisingapore.org/), working with a local hospital on a project to aid in clinicians' workflows during a Caesarean Delivery with a Time-Series related AI Solution. ✨

🎓 I recently graduated from the National University of Singapore with a Masters of Science in Mechanical Engineering, with a focus on AI and Robotics coursework.

I am passionate about anything AI/ML, and I am very excited to learn and grow in this space!

⚡ Fun fact: I play lead guitar for a local artist, [RENE](https://linktr.ee/renemusic), sometimes. I've gone on tour to perform in Taipei and Manila with them!
